<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This repository serves as the official PyTorch codebase for the paper titled "Unraveling the Age Estimation Puzzle: Comparative Analysis of Deep Learning Approaches for Facial Age Estimation". You can find the paper on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04570) here. 

Comparing different age estimation methods poses a challenge due to the unreliability of published results, stemming from inconsistencies in the benchmarking process. Previous studies have reported continuous performance improvements over the past decade using specialized methods; however, our findings challenge these claims.

We argue that, for age estimation tasks outside of the low-data regime, designing specialized methods is unnecessary, and the standard approach of utilizing cross-entropy loss is sufficient. 

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This README is designed to cater to three types of users:
- Users who only want to use the same data splits to ensure comparability with previous state-of-the-art methods, see ["Using the Data Splits"](doc/using_the_data_splits.md)
- Users who want to train the implemented age estimation models using this repository, see ["Using the Repository"](doc/using_the_repository.md)
- Users who want to implement their own methods, use this repository, and compare their results against the state-of-the-art, see ["Implementing New Methods"](doc/implementing_new_methods.md)

For each user type, a dedicated walk-through is provided. Click on the links above to access the relevant sections.
